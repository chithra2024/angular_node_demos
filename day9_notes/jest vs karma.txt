Jest
=====
Created by: Facebook

Type: All-in-one JavaScript testing framework

Use Case: Best for React apps and general unit testing

Runner + Assertion + Mocking: All built-in (no need to configure separately)

Execution: Runs tests in a Node.js environment (not in a real browser)

Speed: Very fast due to parallel test execution and intelligent caching

Setup: Easy to configure and use with zero config for many cases

Snapshot Testing: Built-in support for UI snapshot testing

Code Coverage: Built-in and simple to configure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jest Pros:
==========
Simple and fast

Great for modern frontend (React, Vue, Angular with workarounds)

Rich API and ecosystem

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karma
=====
Created by: AngularJS team (Google)

Type: Test runner (not an assertion library itself)

Use Case: Traditionally used with Angular apps and testing in real browsers

Execution: Launches real browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run tests

Assertion & Mocking: Needs external libraries like Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon

Speed: Slower due to starting and managing browsers

Setup: Requires more configuration (karma.conf.js)

Code Coverage: Available via plugins (e.g., karma-coverage)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karma Pros:
===========
Runs in actual browsers (good for integration tests)

Useful for legacy or browser-dependent code

More representative of real-world behavior
